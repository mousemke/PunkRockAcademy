**My 10 largest punk album influences**
(in no particular order)

-
**Less Than Jake - Losing Streak**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7SJd76Q/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watchv=iA1sq9n78xk&list=PL1865475122D47BE0

Not only the first Punk CD I owned, but also the first music of any kind that I owned.

-
**Physical Fatness**
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyZKg3df8vQ&list=PL8A6AD20499413341

$4 at [The Exclusive Company! ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Exclusive+Co/@43.424593,-88.182728,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x57d8602556242ced?hl=en) Probably the second CD I ever owned. This comp is amazing, but it also open me up to tons of other bands.

-
**Not So Quiet on the Western Front**
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN9zCYVWuRU

This was my first major introduction to Alternative Tentacles and Early 80s punk

-
**Dead Kennedys - Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7SJZCqA/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3VXiyS6zl0

Amazingness!  This led me to Jello Biafra's spoken word albums and eventually to more politically motivated music and actions

-
**Operation Ivy   - Energy**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7SJWN9U/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59hHWeB893Y

This band essentially started their own genre.  So much energy; One of the bands that I really wish I could have seen live.

-
**The Crucifucks - The Crucifucks**
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-m2wLNxlQ0

Amazing old school Wisconsin punk with a sound of their own. A picture of a Philadelphia police officer posing as shot â€” originally part of a public relations campaign -- was used on one of their album's back cover. Four years later, they were sued by the Philadelphia Police Dept.

-
**Against Me! - Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7SJ8KBo/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktPdTu53qt0

This music seemed to be the spawn of the punk scene itself.  To this day these shows are the most dancy, energetic, sing-a-long shows I've ever been to.  This album absolutely defines the early 2000s basement show/ travelling scene for me.

-
**Crass - The Feeding of the 5000**
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKAHU5-pS_A

Heavily political, very recognizable sound.  In a class by themselves.

-
**Blatz / Filth - The Shit Split**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7Tc9odU/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bksp9Npze6M&list=PL7A72123C8993256D

Very dirty, raw sound.  Classic East Bay.

-
**Submission Hold - Waiting for Another Monkey to Throw the First Brick**
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV8FSRs2Ouo

I saw them play their last show.  Amazing.  This showed me the place non-standard
instruments had in punk.

-
**Honorable Mentions** - since the second I started doing this list I had more than 10:

-
**Catch 22 - Kaeseby Nights**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7SJPK5k/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watchv=hLYkwjgokLI&list=PLSTrJxnhZrRVONP7V5mPxIlTjqlWa33US

I think I actually discovered Catch 22 off an old Roadrunner Records Comp, which was odd since the rest of the album was Fear Factory, and other speedmetal. This was played constantly in my 1988 plymouth Voyager.

-
**Propagandhi     - Less Talk, More Rock**
+ http://rd.io/x/QXZn7SJZQWA/
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylIHTl7lIVM

I should have seen them, but they didn't get let into the US.
